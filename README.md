this script will be designed to get a list of links to the actual books in the package "Free Textbooks and Library Link special issue during Covid 19" be the Springer press (the cool ones).
This is the link: https://link.springer.com/search/page/21?facet-content-type=%22Book%22&package=mat-covid19_textbooks&facet-language=%22En%22&sortOrder=newestFirst&showAll=true

# Usage
open dwl.sh and check for DEST to be ok with you or adjust it. Then run like the following: ```sh dwl.sh```
Done.

# License
This code is under AGPL, because why not? And people agreed it would be a good idea: https://toot.kif.rocks/@uniporn/104066484933751796
Now live with it :D

# Thoughts and Prayers
currently the script downloads all formats of the books, pdfs and epubs alike. 
However I am open for submission of patches to fix that, or any other issue you find.
If there is some feature you'd like to discuss first or there is any question - just raise issues, poke me with mail, whatever - I will most likely tell you what I think about it ;)
And my best wishes for your health.
